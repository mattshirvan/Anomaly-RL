# Anomaly Detection in Reinforcement Learning for Goal and Reward Discovery (Anomaly-RL)

## Introduction
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular approach for solving complex control problems. However, when the environment is stochastic or the reward signal is sparse, learning can be slow and inefficient. This proposal presents a new approach to overcome these challenges by combining anomaly detection and reinforcement learning.

## Proposed Approach
Our proposed approach consists of two main stages: anomaly detection and reinforcement learning.

## Anomaly detection: In this stage, we use anomaly detection techniques to analyze the environment and ontologies to identify patterns or events that deviate from the expected behavior. These anomalies may indicate the presence of new rewards or goals that have not been identified yet.
Reinforcement learning: Once anomalies have been identified, RL techniques can be used to explore and exploit these new rewards and goals.
Expected Outcome
We expect that this approach will enable efficient and effective learning in stochastic environments and sparse reward signals. By combining anomaly detection and reinforcement learning, we hope to significantly improve the performance of RL algorithms and make them more applicable to a wider range of control problems.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, we propose a novel approach to reinforcement learning that utilizes anomaly detection to identify changes in environments and ontologies and learn new goals and reward signals. We believe that this approach has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of RL and provide a new approach for solving complex control problems.
